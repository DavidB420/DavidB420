Hi!\
My name is David Badiei, and I am a computer science student at York University

I usually work as an intern during the summer. When I have free time I work on my own projects.

  - [Doors++ (a 64 bit multitasking operating system, still pretty early in development)](https://github.com/DavidB420/doorspp)

# Some noteworthy projects I have worked on in my spare time
